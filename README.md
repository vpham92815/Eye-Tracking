# Eye-Tracking
Senior Projects code

This is the GitHub for the FireGhostOwl eye tracker project for the year 2020-2021

The code here is the iterations I'm going through in order to fufil the object of getting information from the eye for the purposes of finding the angle of the eye, dialation, as well as how open the eyes are.
